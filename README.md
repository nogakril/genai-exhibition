# Gen AI Exhibition üñºÔ∏è

**Data Driven Design Studio ¬∑ Machine Learning √ó The Met Collection**

This project explores the role of the museum curator and challenges the traditional concept of art exhibitions.  
An interactive installation allows participants to create a personalized museum exhibition in real-time, powered by **machine learning** and the **Met Museum‚Äôs open collection**.

## ‚ú® Concept

Museums traditionally reflect the choices of curators, embedding cultural values and hierarchies.  
**Gen AI Exhibition** shifts that power: visitors input free text about themes, emotions, or memories, and an AI system generates a **personalized exhibition on the spot.**

- **Input:** Participants type any text prompt.  
- **AI Matching:** A language model maps the text to semantically related objects in the Met Museum‚Äôs public collection.  
- **Output:** Selected artworks are projected into frames, accompanied by **AI-generated curatorial text** contextualizing the exhibition.

The result is a living, participatory curatorial practice that blends **machine learning, cultural heritage, and audience imagination.**
